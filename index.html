   <div class="container text-center">
  <p class="greenbg lead p-x-md p-y">
          Just picture 468 community leaders standing on the Capitol steps this January&mdash;one for every House and Senate seat up for election in 2018. They explain the plan to the assembled media: they’re running the first national, unified Congressional campaign this country has ever seen. They will win by expanding the volunteer networks and tools that they and thousands of others built during Bernie’s campaign. They will finally give America a way to throw the bums out all at once and replace them with true representatives of the people. They will create a functioning Brand New Congress that will pass Bernie's program. The grassroots goes wild, signs up to volunteer and starts donating!
          </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container text-center">
    <p class="lead ital p-x-md p-y">
    <em>Replacing all of Congress in one fell swoop would normally be impossible. But we have a unique opportunity right now to do just that:</em></p>
    </div>

    <div class="container text-center">
<ul class="iconlist"><li><span class="icon icon-circle"></span>
    A national campaign for a new Congress will generate enough enthusiasm to get people out to vote in these otherwise ignored primary contests, overwhelming boring establishment  candidates. In many districts only 15,000 votes are needed to win! We’ll have 14 months before the primaries to use our national volunteer base to find those voters. Then as the primaries come, mostly in batches of one to five states at a time, we’ll aim the whole movement at those states for GOTV.</li>

    <li><span class="icon icon-circle"></span>As a national campaign, lessons learned in each district will aid all districts, and improvements to tools like dialers, voter files and canvassing apps will benefit everyone immediately.
Donations for the campaign will mostly come through one central website that can tell donors where resources are needed the most at any given time.</li>
    <li><span class="icon icon-circle"></span>The Brand New Congress slate will raise far more money as a national referendum on Congress by tapping into a national donor base than 468 candidates running separately ever could. </li>
    <li><span class="icon icon-circle"></span>The momentum we have right now lets us start much earlier than most candidates and create the best organized campaign this country has ever seen. If we announce in January, we have a whole 14 months before the first Congressional primaries in April.</li>

    </ul>

    <p class="lead ital p-x-md p-y">
    <em>The practical hope of a functional Congress willing to pass bold changes is too good to resist. The political revolution has only just begun! With time on our side, if we combine the economies of scale of one nationally funded campaign with power of the massive local volunteer networks that already exist, we can’t lose.</em></p>

<h3 block-title text-center p-b>What have we learned from the Bernie campaign?</h3>
<div class="container text-center">
<p class="lead ital p-x-md p-y">
    <em>The Bernie Sanders campaign created one of the largest political movements we’ve seen in this country. In doing so, there is a lot that has gone right, but also a lot that we can learn from.  A lot of this can be distilled down to one major takeaway: the power of this movement comes from the volunteers, and we can only create a Brand New Congress if we make this a volunteer-driven campaign. Specifically, this means:</em></p>
     </div>
<div class="container text-center">
    <ul class="iconlist"><li><span class="icon icon-circle"></span>As a national campaign, lessons learned in each district will aid all districts, and improvements to tools like dialers, voter files and canvassing apps will benefit everyone immediately.</li>

    <li><span class="icon icon-circle"></span>Highly committed local volunteers will be the ones who run campaign offices and voter contact operations.</li>
<li><span class="icon icon-circle"></span>A national phone banking operation combined with local canvassing will identify, persuade, and get millions of people out to vote just like on the Bernie campaign&mdash;but national staff must be held accountable to provide high quality, reliable tools to all districts from the very beginning, so we can make full advantage of all the time we have.</li>
    <li><span class="icon icon-circle"></span>A national staff team is necessary to provide tools, handle compliance, and consolidate all our efforts, but there must be open, public lines of feedback to ensure the national staff are doing their jobs well and are accountable to volunteers on the ground.</li>
    <li><span class="icon icon-circle"></span>Campaign staff will be hired from the movement: passion and demonstrated skill trumps experience on past campaigns or political connections. </li>
    <li><span class="icon icon-circle"></span>We will invest early in basic infrastructure like grassroots campaign offices, merchandise, and political staff to handle endorsers/train surrogates.</li>
<li><span class="icon icon-circle"></span>National spokes-candidates will appear on national media and fill stadiums just like Bernie. But we will make sure everyone who comes to a rally leaves with a volunteer assignment!</li>
