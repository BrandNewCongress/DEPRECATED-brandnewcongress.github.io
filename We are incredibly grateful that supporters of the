We are incredibly grateful that supporters of the Brand New Congress campaign have donated nearly $25,000 over just the past four days. 100% of this money will go to fund a summer Barnstorm tour so that BNC organizers can visit dozens of cities in all 50 states. At those meetings, we'll explain this idea in depth, field questions,recruit more organizers and find some of our candidates. In this movement, we are going to need volunteers more than money. But we'll need money too! If you'd like to donate, you can right here: https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/brandnewcongress
